# Memory-Card-game
Hello,
I recently started to learn Front-End developing and decided to make a small game as my project.
I used the 3 main programming languages : HTML, CSS and JS.
By using javascript to generate the andom combination of cards, I managed to make a simple memory card game,
which It turned out to be very solide and very smooth as a small and simple game.

I'll be tring to add a small diffeculty system so I will be more enjoyble, and might test out my limits.
All thought, I will not finish or be going to add extra feauters since this is just a small project to test and improve my skills.
